# Code of Conduct – project-history

`project-history` exists to make developers’ lives easier. That only works if the
community around it is safe, respectful, and focused on building useful tools.

This document sets the minimum standard of behavior for everyone interacting in
the project: maintainers, contributors, users, and visitors.

---

## 1. Our Commitment

We commit to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of:

- age, body size, or appearance  
- disability (visible or invisible)  
- ethnicity, nationality, or race  
- gender identity or expression  
- level of experience or education  
- socio-economic status  
- religion or lack thereof  
- sexual identity or orientation  

We aim for an environment that is:

- **open** – ideas can be questioned  
- **welcoming** – people are not attacked  
- **inclusive** – newcomers are not dismissed  
- **healthy** – disagreements stay professional  

---

## 2. Expected Behavior

Examples of behavior that **supports** this community:

- Show empathy and patience when others are confused or stuck.
- Critique ideas, designs, and code — not people.
- Give and receive feedback in a direct but respectful way.
- Admit mistakes, fix them, and move on without drama.
- Keep the long-term health of the project above personal ego.

In short: **be honest, be direct, and don’t be a jerk.**

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following is **not** acceptable, in any project space (GitHub, social, chat,
meetups, etc.):

- Sexualized language, imagery, or attention of any kind.
- Personal attacks, name-calling, or insults.
- Harassment, stalking, or sustained disruption of discussions.
- Trolling, flame wars, or bad-faith arguments.
- Publishing or threatening to publish others’ private information
  (doxxing) without explicit permission.
- Any behavior that a reasonable person would consider abusive,
  intimidating, or hostile in a professional setting.

If you’re unsure whether something crosses the line, assume that it does and
don’t do it.

---

## 4. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies:

- in all project spaces: issues, PRs, discussions, code review, docs, etc.
- when representing the project in public: using the project name,
  official accounts, or speaking “on behalf of” the project.

---

## 5. Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it to the maintainers:

> **Contact:** `IncludeBrake+conduct@gmail.com`

Include, if possible:

- what happened (with links or screenshots)
- where it happened (issue / PR / discussion / external link)
- when it happened
- any other context that might help

All reports will be handled as promptly and privately as possible. The
maintainers will not publicly identify reporters without explicit consent
unless legally required.

---

## 6. Enforcement & Consequences

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of
Conduct. They may remove or edit comments, commits, code, wikis, issues, or
other contributions that violate these rules.

Consequences are roughly as follows. Maintainers may skip steps in severe cases.

### 1. Correction

**Impact:**  
Minor, first-time issues (e.g. careless wording, one-off rude comment).

**Consequence:**  
Private reminder or warning and a request to adjust behavior. A public apology
may be requested for public incidents.

---

### 2. Formal Warning

**Impact:**  
Patterns of behavior or a more serious single incident.

**Consequence:**  
Official warning with clear conditions. The person may be asked to avoid
further interaction with specific individuals or threads for a period of time.
Ignoring this may lead to a temporary ban.

---

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Impact:**  
Serious or repeated violations; refusal to change behavior after warnings.

**Consequence:**  
Temporary exclusion from all project spaces and interactions. Any attempt to
circumvent the ban (alt accounts, harassment elsewhere related to the project)
may result in a permanent ban.

---

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Impact:**  
Ongoing pattern of abuse; targeted harassment; bigotry; or behavior that makes
participation unsafe for others.

**Consequence:**  
Permanent removal from all project spaces and activities. Banned individuals
may not rejoin under any identity.
